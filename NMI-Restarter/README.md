# 🧠 NMI-Restarter

**NMI-Restarter** is a lightweight Windows utility designed to **restart, stop, or monitor NMI payment terminals** with a simple and intuitive GUI.  
It allows engineers to quickly refresh one or all connected terminals, log restart activity, and view live system status in a single interface.

---

## 🖥️ Overview

Built for technical and field engineers who need fast recovery or maintenance actions for NMI terminal connectors.

- Detects all terminals under the configured directory path  
- Supports **Restart**, **Start**, **Kill**, and **Refresh** operations  
- Logs all activity to a local file for auditing and diagnostics  
- GUI interface eliminates the need for PowerShell or manual restarts  

The tool is ideal for support environments running **multiple payment connectors** or kiosk systems.

## 🧠 Development Notes

NMI-Restarter was developed in **C# (.NET Framework)** using **Windows Forms (WinForms)** for its lightweight GUI.  
The goal was to simplify recovery operations for **NMI payment terminals** by providing engineers with quick visual control over process restarts.  

Key technical highlights:
- Built around `System.Diagnostics.Process` to manage terminal sessions.  
- Implements directory scanning to dynamically list active terminal connectors.  
- Uses asynchronous execution to prevent UI freezing during restart sequences.  
- Writes structured logs (`restart.log`) for every event, improving traceability.  
- Portable `.exe` build for instant use on support laptops without installation.

This design ensures stability in live support environments where quick recovery and minimal downtime are critical.

## ✨ Features

- 🧩 **Auto-detect terminals** — scans directories and lists connected terminals  
- ⚡ **One-click Restart / Restart All** — instantly relaunch terminals  
- 🧰 **Live Controls** — buttons for `Start`, `Kill`, and `Refresh`  
- 🪶 **Lightweight** — portable executable, no installation required  
- 📄 **Logging** — generates a detailed `restart.log` file under `/Logs`  
- ⚙️ **Configurable JSON** — `settings.json` defines connector paths and parameters

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1️⃣ Configure the tool  
Edit your `settings.json` file to match your terminal folder path, for example:  
C:\NMI-CC-Connectors\Terminals

---

### 2️⃣ Run the tool  
Simply run the `.exe` file:  
`NmiRestarterTray.exe`

The interface will display all detected terminals and provide full control over restart actions.

## 🧩 GUI Overview

The application provides the following controls:

| Control | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Dropdown Menu** | Select which terminal to control |
| **Refresh** | Re-scans for active terminals |
| **Start** | Launches the selected terminal |
| **Kill** | Terminates the selected terminal process |
| **Restart** | Restarts the selected terminal |
| **Restart All** | Restarts all detected terminals simultaneously |
| **Log Window** | Displays timestamped messages and status updates |

All actions are recorded in the `restart.log` file within the `/Logs` directory.

---

## 🪄 Folder Structure

| File / Folder | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| `NmiRestarterTray.exe` | Compiled Windows executable |
| `settings.json` | Configuration file containing terminal path |
| `Logs/` | Directory where restart.log is automatically created |
| `README.md` | Documentation for the tool |

## 📐 Design & Implementation

NMI-Restarter was built in **C# (.NET)** using **Windows Forms**.  
The main idea was to make it easy for engineers to restart NMI payment terminals without needing to use command line tools or restart the whole system.  

The program looks for all terminal folders, lists them in the dropdown menu, and lets the user start, stop, or restart them with one click.  
It also keeps a record of every action inside the `restart.log` file so you can check what was done later.

The app runs as a normal desktop tool — no background service or installation needed.  
It’s made to be quick, portable, and reliable for daily use on support laptops or site PCs.
